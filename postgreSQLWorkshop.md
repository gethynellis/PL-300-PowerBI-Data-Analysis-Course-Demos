## üß† PostgreSQL Migration Workshop: Architecture, Concerns & Solutions

**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Location:** End of Chapter 2
**Format:** Group discussion and whiteboarding

---

### üè¢ Case Study: *TechWave Retail Solutions Ltd*

**Company Profile**
TechWave Retail Solutions Ltd is a medium-sized UK-based retail technology company. They provide point-of-sale systems, e-commerce integration, and customer analytics platforms to independent retailers. Their current backend systems run on **SQL Server 2017 Enterprise** and **Oracle 12c**.

**Current Architecture**

* Mix of Windows-based VMs on-premises and some workloads in Azure.
* Core application relies on SQL Server CLR procedures, SSIS packages, and temporal tables.
* Reporting uses SSRS and Power BI.
* A legacy Oracle ERP module stores inventory and supplier data.

**Business Driver for Change**

* Rising licensing costs and increasing pressure to adopt open-source technologies.
* Desire for greater cloud portability and vendor neutrality.
* Planning a phased migration to **PostgreSQL (open-source edition)** across departments.

### ‚ùó TechWave‚Äôs Five Concerns About Migrating to PostgreSQL

1. **Compatibility with Existing Applications**

   * Will PostgreSQL support SQL Server or Oracle-specific features like T-SQL, PL/SQL, temporal tables, or CLR?

2. **Performance and Scalability**

   * Can PostgreSQL deliver comparable performance at scale with large transaction volumes and complex queries?

3. **High Availability and Disaster Recovery**

   * Does PostgreSQL offer equivalent tools for failover, backup, restore, and replication strategies?

4. **Security and Compliance**

   * Will PostgreSQL support robust access control, auditing, and encryption to satisfy internal and external compliance requirements?

5. **Tooling and Ecosystem Support**

   * Is there an equivalent ecosystem to SSMS or Oracle Enterprise Manager, and are managed cloud services mature enough for production use?

## üß© **Group Discussion Questions**

### **1. Application Compatibility**

**Question:**
*TechWave‚Äôs point-of-sale application relies on SQL Server-specific features like temporal tables, T-SQL syntax, and CLR integrations.*
**How can PostgreSQL help ensure compatibility with these application requirements during migration?**

**Consider:**

* Extensions like `Babelfish`
* PL/pgSQL stored procedures and user-defined functions
* SQL standard compliance and cross-DB portability

---

### **2. Performance and Scalability**

**Question:**
*TechWave expects high-volume transactions and fast query response times across large datasets.*
**What PostgreSQL architectural features would help ensure strong performance and scalability?**

**Consider:**

* Shared memory tuning (`shared_buffers`, `work_mem`)
* Table partitioning and parallel query execution
* Use of extensions like Citus for horizontal scaling

---

### **3. High Availability and Disaster Recovery**

**Question:**
*The business requires 24/7 uptime and minimal data loss in the event of failure.*
**What options are available in PostgreSQL for ensuring high availability and robust disaster recovery?**

**Consider:**

* Streaming replication and logical replication
* WAL archiving and point-in-time recovery (PITR)
* HA tools like `Patroni`, `pgBackRest`, and `repmgr`

---

### **4. Security and Compliance**

**Question:**
*The compliance team requires strong data protection, role management, and auditing features.*
**How does PostgreSQL meet enterprise-grade security and compliance standards?**

**Consider:**

* Role-based access control (RBAC) and row-level security (RLS)
* SSL/TLS encryption and support for TDE (via extensions)
* pgAudit and logging configuration for compliance tracking

---

### **5. Tooling and Ecosystem Support**

**Question:**
*TechWave‚Äôs DBAs are used to rich GUIs and cloud tooling from vendors like Microsoft and Oracle.*
**What PostgreSQL tools and ecosystem components are available to support administration, development, and monitoring?**

**Consider:**

* Graphical tools: `pgAdmin`, `DBeaver`, Azure Data Studio
* Monitoring: `pg_stat_statements`, `pgBadger`, Prometheus/Grafana
* Managed services: AWS RDS, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Google Cloud SQL
